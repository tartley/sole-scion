  * Circles rain down on an inclined plane, bouncing off it and each other.
  * A very rudimentary integration of our major dependencies:
    - Chipmunk controls the physics
    - Pyglet does OpenGL rendering and gameloop
  * Only tested on Linux. Reported to work on Windows. Reported to run under
    PyPy too, if you install functools. Anyone tried it on a Mac?
  * Accepts no user input, therefore isn't a game yet.
  * A spike. Not tested. No design, all one big script.
