See bottom of file for tasks that are 'done' but which have not yet been
moved to HISTORY.txt (*=planned task, +=unexpected task)

Harpoon
    * fired with mousebutton or key
    * embeds on impact
    * cable rendering
    * cable physics - first pass, no collision with walls
    * first pass: vanishes when key released
    * cable reeled with up/down (mouse or keys)
    * releases & rewinds when key is released

Rescuees
    * Stand around
    * 

Handling
    * left/right controls stop imparting torque at fast spins
    * Damp down the rotation just a little more
    * Probably increase torque control a tad to compensate for that

Level Builder
    + irregular shaped rooms
    + add a buffer for testing 'new_verts_ok', to prevent rooms which don't
      touch from coming too close

Furniture
    + irregular generated rocks
    + rocks start out resting on the floor

Infrastructure
    * MUST automatically find all tests for run_test
    + or use nose to run tests. delete 'run all tests' and the like?
    + can we fix LD_LIBRARY_PATH from within python, dispensing with need
      for run.sh and run.bat to set it? Would make running tests easier.
    * Windows binary distribution, including Shapely DLL
    * Linux binary distribution
    * Need help for Mac binary distribution.
    + startup should assert dependancies being used are local, not installed

Interaction
    + pause key
    + toggle fullscreen key
    + handle window resize

Testing
    + use michael's Mock instead of our Listener, for sake of monkey
      patching

Infrastructure
    + there are some test failures on Windows
    + quick architecture diagram. review diffs to reality.
    + consistently use either abs or rel imports for solescion packages
    + remove #! lines if tests can't be called directly, or if -O flag
      can't be used
    + auto upload source/binary distributions? set as featured downloads?
      http://code.google.com/p/support/source/browse/trunk/scripts/googlecode_distutils_upload.py

Svg Loader
    * Load svg from Inkscape to define rigid bodies and their appearance?
    (check out squirtle)

Sound
    * sound effects
    * music

Rendering
    * Render using GL_TRIANGLES in pyglet batches
    * line-of-sight masking
    * Render only rooms, and their contents, that are on-screen.

Rescuees
    * guys. Physics: a disc? Render: a textured quad?
    * Scatter maze with guys to rescue
    * guys wander left / right on flat surfaces
    * guys die in heavy collisions
    * guys climb into vehicle

== DONE ==

* Maze generation
    + integrate Shapely
    * Autogenerate a set of rooms to form a maze of sorts.
        * create a regular poly room from num_faces and first two points
        * choose a random wall from all existing rooms
        * add new room onto chosen wall
        * iterate
        * test for intersections and reject
    * choose a seed to generate an interesting large maze
    + one very large room to represent 'above ground'

Technical Debt
    + fix failing tests
    + tidy up run* all over the place
    + fix pylint
    + move dependancies inside solescion dir?
        I think not. Searches, pylint, nose would all include dependancies
    + source distribution using setuptools instead of zip
    + application takes version number from setup.py
    * setup.py py2exe_zip() creates archive with unwanted 'dist' path cmpt.
    * Windows binary distributable.
    + upload new source/binary versions as featured downloads

Keypresses:
    + quit (done)
    + screenshot (done)

Infrastructure:
    + -v prints version of application and of pyglet, pymunk, shapely & python
