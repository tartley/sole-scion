See bottom of file for tasks that are 'done'

for v0.2 : Engine

  * integrate new version of pyglet: 1.1

for v0.3 : Avatar

  * Give the player control over one of the entities: To move around, jump, and 
    drag adjacent entities about.

for v0.4 : Maze

  * Handle multiple connected room polygons.
  * Autogenerate a set of rooms to form a maze of sorts.

for v0.5 : Performance

  * Render faster, using Vertex Object Buffers instead of glVertex() calls.
  * Render only rooms (and their contents) that are on-screen.
  * Render object decorations.
  * Tune pymunk parameters
  * Another other easy win performance tweaks

for v0.6 : Quest

  * Other objects in the maze.
  * Rocks: High density, high friction, low elasticity.
  * Eggs: Low density, low friction, high elasticity.
  * Eggs are tough, but can be broken.
  * Game completion - return all eggs to the nest to win.
    Display stats. Restart.

for v0.7 : Death

    * Death - get squished to restart from a collected egg
    * Abandon - [esc] will give up, restarting from a collected egg.
        After a while, abandoned avatar is replaced by a skeleton.
    * Game over - no eggs left.
        Display stats, restart.

for v0.8 : Achievements

    * Persist highscores
    * Achievements
        * Longest free-fall
        * Hardest impact
        * Most brethren rescued
        * Fastest game completion
        * Least bretheren lost at completion

for v0.9 : Install

  * Windows binary distributable.
  * Acceptance tests on Windows hopefully using VMWare to run from Linux.


== DONE ==

for v0.1 : Spike

  * Circles rain down on an inclined plane, bouncing off it and each other.
  * A big spike demonstrating the integration of our major dependancies,
    pymunk for rigid-body dynamics, pyglet for openGL graphics.

for v0.2 : Engine

  * Reimpliment in a test-driven manner
  * Replace inclined-plane with a single polygonal room, within which circles
    are free to move.
  * Handle moving polygon entities ('blocks') as well as discs.
  * Pymunk only eats clockwise wound vertices. Barf on counterclockwise.
  * Move the existing 'is_convex()' utility function from Block to 
    utils.geometry, broaden it to a generic 'assert_valid_poly(),
    and use it to verify Rooms verts
  * sort out the interface to creating Entities and Shapes
    - see Entity_test.test_new_interface()
  * Entities should automatically figure their centre of mass and offset
    vertex co-ordinates from that.
  * Entities with compound shapes (ie collection of discs and blocks)
  * Rename Entity as RigidBody
  * Figure out the bug that is borking collision detection for compound
    RigidBodies : pymunk.Poly() did not heed its 'offset' param. To work
    around, Blocks no longer maintain an offset, but update their verts
    directly, and create Polys with a zero offset.
  * Rename shapes (Discs, Blocks) as 'shards' to differ with pymunk.Shape
    This would eliminate odd references to rigidbody.shapes[0].shape,
    Renamed 'RigidBody' to 'chunk' while I was at it.
  * Define a few materials: Granite, Gold, Bamboo, Ice, Rubber, Air.
  * Shapes have a material, which determines their color, density, elasticity,
    friction.
  * World.material=Granite. Renderer draws walls in world.material color.
    World no longer needs a color.
  * Room.material=Air. Renderer draws rooms in room.material color.
    Room no longer needs a color.
