for v0.2

  * Handle moving polygon entities ('blocks') as well as discs.
  * Entities with compound shapes (ie collection of discs and blocks)
  * Shapes have a material, which determines their color, density, elasticity,
    friction.

for v0.3

  * Give the player control to move one of the entities around, and pick up
    and drag around adjacent entities.

for v0.4

  * Handle multiple connected room polygons.
  * Autogenerate a set of rooms to form a maze of sorts.

for v0.5

  * Render faster, using Vertex Object Buffers instead of glVertex() calls.
  * Render only rooms (and their contents) that are on-screen.
  * Render object decorations.

for v0.6

  * Other objects in the maze.
      * Rocks: High density, high friction, low elasticity.
      * Eggs: Low density, low friction, high elasticity.
      * Eggs are tough, but can be broken.

for v0.7

    * Game completion - return all eggs to the nest to win.
        Display stats. Restart.
    * Death - get squished to restart from a collected egg
    * Abandon - [esc] will give up, restarting from a collected egg.
        After a while, abandoned avatar is replaced by a skeleton.
    * Game over - no eggs left.
        Display stats, restart.

for v0.8

    * Persist highscores
    * Achievements
        * Longest free-fall
        * Hardest impact
        * Most bretheren rescued
        * Fastest game completion
        * Least bretheren lost at completion

for v0.9

  * Windows binary distributable.
  * Acceptance tests on Windows hopefully using VMWare to run from Linux.
