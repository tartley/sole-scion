v0.2, "Engine", 15 Aug 2008, week 10 of 12
  * Now thoroughly unit tested, and has a basic acceptance test.
  * Reasonable internal architecture defined.
  * Replace inclined-plane with a single polygonal room, within which circles
    bounce around.
  * Handle moving polygon entities ('blocks') as well as discs.
  * Pymunk only eats clockwise wound vertices. Barf on counterclockwise.
  * Move the existing 'is_convex()' utility function from Block to 
    utils.geometry, broaden it to a generic 'assert_valid_poly(),
    and use it to verify Rooms verts
  * sort out the interface to creating Entities and Shapes
    - see Entity_test.test_new_interface()
  * Entities should automatically figure their centre of mass and offset
    vertex co-ordinates from that.
  * Entities with compound shapes (ie collection of discs and blocks)
  * Rename Entity as RigidBody
  * Figure out the bug that is borking collision detection for compound
    RigidBodies : pymunk.Poly() did not heed its 'offset' param. To work
    around, Blocks no longer maintain an offset, but update their verts
    directly, and create Polys with a zero offset. UPDATE: Confirmed, this
    is a bug in Pymunk get_points(), to be fixed in a future release.
  * Rename shapes (Discs, Blocks) as 'shards' to differ with pymunk.Shape
    This would eliminate odd references to rigidbody.shapes[0].shape,
    Renamed 'RigidBody' to 'chunk' while I was at it.
  * Define a few materials: Granite, Gold, Bamboo, Ice, Rubber, Air.
  * Shapes have a material, which determines their color, density, elasticity,
    friction.
  * World.material=Granite. Renderer draws walls in world.material color.
    World no longer needs a color.
  * Room.material=Air. Renderer draws rooms in room.material color.
    Room no longer needs a color.
  * run with new version of pyglet: 1.1 : no changes reqd
  * label the project with a version number : Called it v0.1.9
  * try out using a convensional pyglet gameloop again : It still doubles the
  framerate from 30fps to 60fps when i move the mouse around.

v0.1, "Spike", 17 Jun 08, week 2 of 12.
  * Circles rain down on an inclined plane, bouncing off it and each other.
  * A very rudimentary integration of our major dependencies:
    - Chipmunk controls the physics
    - Pyglet does OpenGL rendering and gameloop
  * Only tested on Linux. Reported to work on Windows. Reported to run under
    PyPy too, if you install functools. Anyone tried it on a Mac?
  * Accepts no user input, therefore isn't a game yet.
  * A spike. Not tested. No design, all one big script.
