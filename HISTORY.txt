v0.2, 6 Aug 08, week 8 of 12
  * Is now unit tested, and has a basic acceptance test.
  * Internal architecture now defined (previous spike was one big script)
  * A handful of circular entities now bounce around inside a single
    polygonal room.

v0.1, 17 Jun 08, week 2 of 12.
  * A very rudimentary integration of our major dependencies.
  * Chipmunk controls the physics, Pyglet does rendering and gameloop.
  * Circles rain down the screen, striking an inclined plane.
  * Only tested on Linux. Reported to work on Windows. Reported to run under
    PyPy too, if you install functools. Anyone tried it on a Mac?
  * Accepts no user input, therefore isn't a game yet.
