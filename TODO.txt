Technical Debt


  + source distribution using setuptools instead of zip
  * Windows binary distributable.
  + move dependancies inside solescion dir?
  + use michael's Mock instead of our Listener
  + use nose to run tests. delete 'all tests' and the like

Maze

  * Handle multiple connected room polygons.
  * Autogenerate a set of rooms to form a maze of sorts.
  + randomly generate in-room rocks

Interaction

  + Keypresses:
    + quit
    + pause
    + screenshot
    + toggle fullscreen

Infrastructure

  + use michael foord's Mock instead of our own 'Listener' - for its additional
    ability to conveniently patch out attributes of modules
  + check out wossname's cheat sheet of python standard practices,
    for example using __version__ attribute.
